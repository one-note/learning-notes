Kubernetes (k8s) is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Here are the key components of a Kubernetes cluster:

### Master Components

1. **etcd**:
   - A distributed key-value store that holds the cluster's state and configuration data.

2. **API Server**:
   - Exposes the Kubernetes API, acting as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. It receives REST requests for modifications and provides API services to interact with the cluster.

3. **Scheduler**:
   - Responsible for placing (scheduling) pods on nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

4. **Controller Manager**:
   - Runs various controllers that regulate the state of the cluster, ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state. Examples include the Node Controller, Replication Controller, and Endpoints Controller.

5. **Cloud Controller Manager**:
   - Integrates with cloud provider APIs to manage resources like load balancers, storage, and networking. It allows Kubernetes to interact with the underlying cloud infrastructure.

### Node Components

1. **Kubelet**:
   - An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures that containers are running in pods and communicates with the API server.

2. **Kube-proxy**:
   - Maintains network rules on nodes to allow network communication to your pods. It handles routing of traffic and load balancing for services.

3. **Container Runtime**:
   - The software responsible for running containers. Examples include Docker, containerd, and CRI-O. The kubelet interacts with the container runtime to launch and manage containers.

### Additional Components

1. **Pod**:
   - The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing a single instance of a running process in the cluster. A pod can contain one or more containers.

2. **ReplicaSet**:
   - Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Provides declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets. It allows rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling.

4. **Service**:
   - Defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them, often used to expose pods internally or externally.

5. **ConfigMap** and **Secret**:
   - Mechanisms to manage configuration data and sensitive information, such as passwords and tokens, respectively.

6. **Ingress**:
   - Manages external access to services, typically HTTP, providing load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

### Example Architecture

                  |              |
            [ Worker Nodes ]
